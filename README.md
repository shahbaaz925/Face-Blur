 Below is a sample `README.md` for a Python code project that uses OpenCV (`cv2`) to capture a live video stream, detect human faces, identify their positions, and blur the detected faces while keeping the rest of the frame unchanged.

```markdown
# Live Video Stream with Face Detection and Blurring

This Python project demonstrates how to create a live video stream using OpenCV (`cv2`), detect human faces in the video stream, identify their positions, and apply blurring to the detected faces while preserving the rest of the frame.

## Prerequisites

Before running the code, make sure you have the following libraries installed:

- OpenCV (`cv2`)
- NumPy

You can install these libraries using `pip`:

```bash
pip install opencv-python numpy
```

## Usage

1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shahbaaz925/Face-Blur/blob/a521397db66eeba846d3dbadaec9a88a29b75286/code.py
cd Face-Blur
```

2. Run the Python script:

```bash
python code.py
```

This will start the live video stream with face detection and blurring.

## Configuration

You can adjust the following parameters in the `live_video_face_detection.py` script:

- `face_cascade_path`: Path to the Haar Cascade Classifier for face detection (you can download it from OpenCV's GitHub repository).
- `blur_factor`: The degree of blurring to be applied to the detected faces. Increase for stronger blurring.
- `min_face_size`: Minimum face size to consider for detection. Adjust based on your needs.
- `scale_factor`: Scaling factor for the image for faster processing.

## Credits

This project is based on OpenCV and uses the Haar Cascade Classifier for face detection.

## License

Remember to customize the repository URL, prerequisites, usage instructions, and configuration details according to your project structure and needs. Also, make sure to include the actual Python code in the repository (`live_video_face_detection.py`) for others to use and test.
